An android application made with Android Studio (fun board game for all ages - Reversi). My First Project and First Android Application. This is a high school student's attempt at making a game bot for the famous game of Reversi and learning how to make apps and game bots. The first edition only made the move in which it scored the highest points ( which doesn't make it hard to beat). The current edition does not look any moves ahead, rather assigns a strategic value to each position on the board and plays with a strategy in mind.
